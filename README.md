My First Single Page Application Using ReactJS! CS612
Your Single Page Web Application:
● Create a simple single page blog static website.
● The page should have a 2-column layout
● You should include 3 blog posts in the “Main” sections of the page.
○ Post should include the following: 

■ Title (H1)
● This should be a working link that goes to the page that displays the whole blog post.
■ Date (of the post)
 
■ Summary (of the post) of the blog post. This should include an image and text.
■ Body (of the post) - Full blog post to be displayed when you click on the “Title” links for the corresponding post on the homepage. Your post should also display the same image from the summary displayed on the main page.
○ Note, your blog posts should at least “look real” even if it displays latin “dummy text,” though I’d prefer it be real content.
● In the “Nav” section include a link that goes to the homepage of your blog page. It should also include the following
○ A div that displays content from a third party API. This call must be an AJAX call that updates the div every 5 seconds.
■ Examples of APIs you can use:
● Display your last 5 “Tweets” or the last 5 “Tweets” from the public
sample firehouse using the ​Twitter API​.
● Google news headlines - ​Google News API
